# Self-Healing Deployment Framework

[ðŸš€ How We Taught Code to Deploy Itself](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-taught-code-deploy-itself-rami-alkhateeb-arywc)

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**. We implemented it for Python scripts, but the principles are **language-agnostic** and can be applied to any language or runtime. The core idea is to take a piece of source code with its dependencies, validate it, wrap it into a microservice, and deploy it automatically â€” with **self-healing loops** that retry, fix, and redeploy until everything works.

> Think of it like giving your code superpowers: it doesnâ€™t just sit there waiting for you to fix every little bug, it fights back, heals itself, and eventually makes it into a live service.

## Stage 1: Input Manager Agent

The Input Manager takes in a Python script (with a `run()` function) and a `requirements.txt` file. It loops through unit testing and code adjustments until all tests pass. If something is missing, like a dependency, it adds it automatically and retries.

## Stage 2: Service Generator Agent

Once the code is validated, the Service Generator Agent wraps it into a microservice. It connects the service to a messaging system (RabbitMQ or Kafka), sets up Docker, and generates supporting files like **Docker Compose** and **AsyncAPI documentation**.

---

## Stage 3: Deployer Agent

The Deployer Agent takes the generated service folder and runs best-practice checks before deployment. It ensures dependencies are installed, Docker builds succeed, and the service can be started without errors. If something fails, it logs and retries.

## Language-Agnostic Potential

This PoC is designed for Python, but the principle can be applied anywhere. For example, this can be self-healing services in **Java**, **Node.js**, or **Go**. The system could help automate:

- Continuous deployment pipelines  
- Edge services  
- IoT devices  
- Machine learning models that need to be retrained and redeployed

## Next Steps

Weâ€™ve proven that self-healing pipelines are possible. Next steps:

- Supporting multiple languages  
- Adding smarter AI-assisted debugging  
- Auto-scaling services based on usage  
- Integrating with CI/CD tools for enterprise use
